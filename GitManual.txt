this is how to use git from the WAD2 final project I had to do

git add -A                                                                  //this adds all non commited files to the current commit
git commit -m "<your message>"                                              //this commits your files, and add a message, ommit -m to use vim
git push                                                                    //push the commit to your current branch
git checkout <name of branch>                                               //switch branches
git status                                                                  //view the status of the files you have changed that have not yet been commited

//To ignore a file or a file type make a .gitignore in the base dir, and add the files like bash format
.pyc
wsgi.py
folder/test.txt

//then to remove the files from the online version, and remove cashed versions of the files do
git rm --cached <file>

//to fork a repo, use the gui on the main page
//then to link it to the original one do this
cd into/cloned/fork-repo
git remote add upstream git://github.com/ORIGINAL-DEV-USERNAME/REPO-YOU-FORKED-FROM.git
git fetch upstream

//then to get the version posted on github use
git pull upstream master

git pull                                                                    //this pulls the branch repo from the github website

//for merge issues, once it happens, go the the files it says has problms with and delete the necesary stuff
//format:

<<<<<<<<<
text from your commit
=========
test that has overwritten the other
>>>>>>>>>

//just delete the styling and the unwanted code, then add, commit, and push
